# Every Cell is Code

[Discord server](https://discord.gg/fSMwfn8sKw)

**Every Cell is Code** is an infinite grid where each cell is a living JavaScript block — a self-contained WebWorker with its own canvas.
Each block can render graphics, communicate with its neighbors, and evolve over time.
Together, they form a programmable universe — decentralized, reactive, and alive.
